### Idea Initiation

ASK YOURSELF BEFORE START:

- What problems and pain points do I want to solve?
- How might I help users with that problem?
- What kind of app am I designing? (e.g., On Demand,
- Dating, Social)
- What is my app supposed to do?
- What is the unique selling point of my app?
- How is my app different from my competitors?
- How will my app appeal to my users?

> Research is a key step in designing the user experience

Market research: 

1. Survey your potential customers
2. Collect relevant data (Social Networks, Statistics,...)
3. Analyze your competitors
4. Apply results to your product
